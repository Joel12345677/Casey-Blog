<h2>Hi! I'm Casey</h2>
    <p> A bit about me...</p>

    <p>I love drawing and being creative and since owning a house this has been expressed more especially through interior design. I have a sketch book where I have random doodles and draw things I see, however I do enjoy using ProCreate on the iPad.
        I have created greeting cards which I give to family and friends, and sketch rooms in our house as they are and then how I want them to be.</p>Â 
    
    <p>I recently completed an Interior Design course online and gained myself a Diploma!
        I am now looking to expand my knowledge and see where this will take me, I've recently found a love for gardening (hopefully I'll get better with practice).</p>
    <p>I have always been a very organised and clean person, everything in our house has a place.</p>
